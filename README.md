# U.S. Web Design System Components for Webflow

## About this project
This UI kit is a collection of components and design tokens built in [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) based on the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) (USWDS). The purpose is to enable rapid prototyping for content and interactions using the default USWDS components we know and love. This is work in progress and [feedback is welcome](https://github.com/pglevy/uswds-components-for-webflow/issues). Not an official U.S. government project.

1. Create a Webflow account.
2. Go the project page in the [Webflow Showcase](https://webflow.com/website/US-Web-Design-System-Components?s=uswds-components).
